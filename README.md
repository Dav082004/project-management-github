# 🧑‍🏫 Project Management with GitHub: Organizing and Tracking Software Development

## 📌 Overview

This repository is designed as a companion to the **Module 3: Workshop on Project Management with GitHub**. It includes materials, live demo examples, and resources to help students and new project managers learn how to use GitHub for organizing and tracking software development projects.

## 🌟 Target Audience

- University students
- Developers
- Aspiring or new project managers

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

1. Use **GitHub Projects** to organize tasks and track progress.
2. Integrate **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests** into a collaborative workflow.
3. Automate repetitive tasks with **GitHub Actions**.

## 💡 Why this matters (Pain, Dream, Fix)
